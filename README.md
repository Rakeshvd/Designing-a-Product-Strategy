In this project I will be preparing a product strategy and pitch product vision.

Involves product identification,market research,competition analysis,roadmap creation to product pitch.

Project Scenario(madeup):

LinkedIn is trying to expand its job market offerings by creating an app that will recommend the best jobs to recent college graduates based on their skills and preferences.
Your team has been tasked with researching the market for this offering, the kinds of data needed, how to connect this with other LinkedIn offerings and how to best monetize it.
